#### Description

**Type50** is a browser-based typing speed test that measures how fast and accurately a user can type within a selected time limit. It is inspired by common typing practice apps but is built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî without any external frameworks or libraries.

The user can select a duration (30, 60, or 120 seconds) from the top menu. Once selected, the application begins a countdown and displays a randomly shuffled list of simple English words. As the user types, each character is checked in real-time against the target text. Correct characters are displayed normally, while incorrect ones are shown in red. At the end of the countdown, the app shows the user‚Äôs words-per-minute (WPM) and typing accuracy.

## Features

- ‚è± Time limit selector (30s, 60s, 120s)
- üß† Real-time character checking and visual feedback
- üìä Calculation of WPM and character-based accuracy
- üîÅ Restart feature to reset the test instantly
- üé® Simple, focused UI using Flexbox and a chocolate-dark theme
- üß© Custom word list built into JavaScript for randomization

## Folder Structure and Files

### `index.html`
This is the main HTML file of the app. It includes:
- A header with a logo and time buttons
- Countdown timer display
- A dynamic typing area (`text_area`) and target word area (`text_generating_area`)
- A restart button that reloads the challenge
- A link to the external CSS and JavaScript files

### `style/style.css`
This file contains all the visual styling:
- Layout is handled with Flexbox for vertical centering
- Colors: chocolate background with black/gray panels and white text
- Styles for word highlighting, the countdown display, and hover effects
- Monospaced font for consistent character width (important for typing apps)

### `js/script.js`
The core logic of the application is here:
- DOM references are created using `getElementById`
- A large word list is shuffled each time using `Math.random()`
- `main()` function initializes state, starts the timer, and enables typing
- `beforeinput` event is used instead of `input`, which works better with `contenteditable` divs
- Characters typed are compared to the target string, and each match/mismatch is rendered immediately with color
- Final results are shown using a formula for WPM:
WPM = (characters with spaces / 5)√ó(60 / seconds)
Accuracy = (correct characters / total typed characters) √ó 100%

- The caret is programmatically kept at the end using `document.createRange()` and `getSelection()`
- Restart button simply re-triggers the selected time option

## Design Decisions

- **`contenteditable` div instead of `<input>` or `<textarea>`**  
This allows full control over rendering each character (e.g. coloring individual letters), which is not possible with standard form inputs.

- **No external libraries**  
Everything is written in vanilla JavaScript to keep it lightweight and readable.

- **Single-page app structure**  
No need to reload the page or navigate ‚Äî all logic is handled in one view.

## What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- `contenteditable` quirks and caret positioning
- Dynamic styling with JavaScript
- Building complete frontend-only apps
- Debugging real-time input logic
- Structuring code into clear sections (HTML, CSS, JS)

## Challenges Faced

- **Caret jump issue**: Every time `innerHTML` was updated, the typing caret moved to the beginning. I solved this by manually resetting the selection and collapsing the caret at the end.
- **Handling `beforeinput` safely**: I needed fine control over what the user types, and this event gave more flexibility than `input`.
- **Character tracking**: It was tricky to handle spaces, deletions, and measuring both correct and incorrect input character-by-character in real-time.

## AI Tool Usage

I used ChatGPT to guide and debug specific parts of the JavaScript code ‚Äî especially the caret positioning and WPM/accuracy calculation logic. However, I wrote all the code myself and fully understood and modified every part before submitting. This tool was used for learning and clarification purposes only.

## Future Improvements

If I had more time, I would:
- Add mobile responsiveness
- Store user results locally for progress tracking
- Allow pasting or uploading custom text samples
- Add visual countdown animations
- Build a backend to store and compare global scores
